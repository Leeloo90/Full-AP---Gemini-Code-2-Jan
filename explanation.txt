I am a non-interactive CLI agent and do not have an "interactive mode" that can be activated. My operational parameters are fixed to execute commands directly when instructed, within the boundaries of allowed tools. The limitations you are encountering (e.g., inability to run `git status` or `npm install`) are due to the specific tool access granted to me in this environment, not a "mode" I can switch. Please check the documentation for how to grant me additional tool permissions if needed for future tasks.
